                      <p class="card-text">Designers devise and explore alternatives as they work. Current parametric modeling tools can work against this essential feature of design work: they require advanced skills in constructing hierarchies of elements and defining relationships among them. Successful exploration is contingent on designers’ ability to interact with complex parametric representations. As a consequence, designers often make hard commitments to design decisions at an early stage of the design process, when they have not yet found potentially viable designs, nor have they received enough feedback about the alternatives they are exploring. Parametric modeling shares many activities with text-based content creation such as writing, for example, combining elements in different sequences, composing hierarchies of elements, varying properties, binding entities through relationships, replacing content, cross-referencing elements, and assembling wholes from parts. The similarities in both domains, and the simpler context of text, inspired us to build a text-editing prototype that focuses on developing a hierarchical, multi-state, data model that supports parallel exploration of alternatives. Unobstructed by the complexity of parametric modeling, we developed Alt.Text. We hypothesize that the features of Alt.Text are portable to other domains, not only that of parametric modeling.

Yet, with few and limited exceptions, current tools handle just a single design model at a time, forcing users to adopt various ad-hoc strategies for dealing with multiple design alternatives. We describe CAMBRIA, a multi-state prototype tool for simultaneously managing multiple 2D vector graphics models. Based on analysis of expert feedback, we propose an initial set of system design guidelines for building graphics editing systems capable of managing multiple, simultaneously available design solutions. We believe that these guidelines can be successfully applied in other areas of work in which people consider multiple alternatives.

                    <p class="card-text">In the current rapid development of parametric design tools the underlying computational-technology outpaces interface design. Interaction with these tools is becoming cognitively more demanding – for example, designers must switch between different views, manipulate views to adjust working context in relation to the model, select operations with complex parameters, and differentiate reference geometry from design geometry. The goal of this study is to understand users' cognitive capabilities and limitations in the context of parametric design so that more natural interfaces can be developed.

                    <p class="card-text">Design collaboration relies on cognitive tools such as analog media and digital peripheral devices, and shows the characteristics of distributed cognition (Hutchins, 1995). It is a social and complex activity involving multiple agents communicating and using external cognitive tools to encode, decode, and share information in the process of collaborative task completion. The systems supporting this activity should meet the 'principle of least collaboration effort' (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986) that proposes that agents in collaboration minimize their effort in presentation and acceptance of arguments (information). They should also adapt the minimal interference principle to ensure task completion to be as simple as possible. We have yet to see a design-collaboration support system that adapts these views. Currently, collaboration uses dispersed mixed media that is often overloaded with representations and functionality, thus preventing seamless information sharing. Designers are required to spend extra effort collecting information using peripheral devices and in system management when sharing information. This hinders design collaborations, as the system becomes a bottleneck in information exchange. Such systems go against Clark's principle (1986) by imposing overheads that potentially lead to designers neglecting to both add and retrieve information. The overheads are also observed when associating information within a design process because existing information is effectively inaccessible.

                    <p class="card-text">Visual analytics tools provide powerful visual representations to support sense-making processes. Analysts typically repeatedly work through a series of steps, varying various parameters each time. Few visual analytics tools support this process well, nor do they provide support for visualizing and understanding the analysis process itself. To help analysts understand, explore, reference, and reuse their analysis process, we developed a new visual analytics system called CZSaw (See-Saw) that provides an editable and re-playable history navigation channel in addition to multiple visual representations of document collections and contained entities (in a manner inspired by Jigsaw). Conventional history navigation tools range from basic undo and redo to branching timelines of user actions. In CZSaw's approach, user interactions are first translated into a script language that drives the underlying scripting-driven propagation system. The latter allows analysts to edit analysis steps, and ultimately to program them. Second, built on this base are both a history view showing progress and alternative paths, and a dependency graph showing the underlying logic of the dependencies among the results of each step. These tools result in a visual model of the sense-making process, letting analysts visualize their analysis process, and thus reinterpret the problem, explore alternatives, extract analysis patterns from the existing process, and reuse the patterns with other related analyses. The CZSaw group was awarded the VAST 2010 Mini Challenge 1 award for "Outstanding Interaction Model." It was also awarded, jointly with two other Simon Fraser University teams using other visual analytics tools, a Grand Challenge award for "Excellent Student Team Analysis"

                    <p class="card-text">Clearly, exploring multiple alternatives can lead to better designs. Despite this well known fact, current computer-aided design systems provide only the most rudimentary tools for generating, storing, and visualizing alternatives. Hysterical space is a novel approach to discover alternatives in the solution space by using the interaction history with a parametric model. Implicit in any parametric model are the states a designer might have reached by combining variable settings in new ways. Such a model exhibits hysteresis, that is, path dependence — thus the name hysterical space. We give a simple definition of hysterical space as the Cartesian product of variable settings. It provides orderings of the space that yield feasible interactive search strategies. In turn, these orderings suggest interaction designs, which we report as working prototypes. Limited user evaluation supports a claim that hysterical space may be a useful approach to design space exploration.

                    <p class="card-text">Designers reflect-in and reflect-on their design process, for this they need a record of their design moves. In many cases the design process is as important as the design outcome itself. In parametric CAD (pCAD) this is particularly true as the record of designer actions are the elements on which the parametric model is built. Current pCAD systems provide designers with limited tools for recording, viewing or analyzing the design process. We propose the Design Analytics framework to characterize the design process as an artefact for design; the framework consists of design process feedback, tools for analysis and enabling the re-exploration of the design space based on analytic reasoning. The Design ReExplorer prototype was developed to test these ideas and evaluate its insertion and viability in real-world scenarios through an expert panel study. The results of the study are favourable with positive feedback and multiple suggestions for future work.

Such experience is part of what makes them experts. Some of these reusable solutions can be expressed in what are known as design patterns. Patterns express design work at a tactical level, above simple editing and below overall conception. A pattern comprises several components, including a name, a problem description, an abstract solution and a discussion of consequences.

                    <p class="card-text">In building design, analysis, and manufacturing, architects, civil, mechanical and electrical engineers use Computer-Aided Design (CAD) systems from the earliest stages of design to construction. A typical CAD system’s graphical user interface (GUI) provides a wide range of capabilities. However, designers and engineers who want to engage repetitive, complex or exploratory design ideas must use both the GUI and programming. Most such designers are amateur programmers acting as end-users, not system developers---they have relatively little formal education in computer science or programming. The literature shows that end-user programmers find difficulty when the programming is separate or different from their main task (design, analysis, etc.). Separation of design and program requires switching between tasks, with consequent loss of both focus and efficiency.

Some common themes found in architectural animations included: (1) the restless, roaming camera; (2) the marketing myths these images portray; and (3) the lifeless spaces. We compare these animations to video portrayals of space produced by several artists and filmmakers. We identify and propose new patterns for spatial portrayal that architects could use to improve architectural animations. These patterns include: (1) patterns of camera movements or stillness, (2) patterns of sequencing and editing; (3) patterns of spatial construction; (4) patterns of architectural narratives; and (5) patterns of bringing space alive.

                    <p class="card-text">We present GEM-NI – our new system for creating and managing alternatives in generative design. Making alternatives is a key feature of creative work, yet is poorly supported in most extant tools. GEM-NI enables various forms of parallel editing via new methods to control which alternatives are affected by a given edit. We also introduce a novel method for post-hoc synchronization of alternatives, which we called synch paste. Moreover, our system supports a number of ways to create alternatives, including a new method for creating alternatives from a graphical history that retains the lineage. Another way to create alternatives is via an interactive design gallery interface, which includes several improvements over previous work.

                    <p class="card-text">Designers, architects and engineers use simulation tools in predicting the energy usage of buildings. Indeed, use of such tools is increasing in practice, pushed by increasing client and societal demands to improve building performance. Current simulation tools tend to focus on the physical aspect of the building`s energy usage and, as a simplifying assumption, confine the consideration of the inhabitant interaction to fixed, scheduled or rule-based} behavior. Yet, the literature clearly identifies that how inhabitants use buildings has a large impact on the energy consumption in all buildings (including, and perhaps especially so-called sustainable buildings) and is one of the reasons for the vast difference between predicted and actual energy consumption. Further, inhabitants have various options to choose for the desired comfort and the choice may depend on their understanding of how their interaction affects the energy consumption. Both inhabitants' and designers' perspectives present challenges. Neither seems to ``talk" to the other. A common language, an ``eco-dialect", between designers and the inhabitants, might help the situation. The lack of mutual understanding could be one of the reasons for the vast difference in the predicted energy and the actual energy usage by the inhabitants. On one hand, decisions taken by architects and engineers are largely hidden from inhabitants: people do not and cannot know how designers intend buildings to be controlled, nor do they know how a building might react to a control decision. On the other hand, designers know little of what inhabitants actually do in controlling buildings. Two questions seem evident. The first is ``How do inhabitant's know what action they need to take to achieve the desired comfort in any environmental condition?" The second is ``How can designers predict and support productive inhabitant action?"

                    <p class="card-text">Exploring problems through multiple alternatives is a key aspect of design. We present a prototype system as an extension to existing parametric CAD tools that enables parallel generation and editing of design alternatives. The system is built on two fundamental ideas. First, use of subjunctive dependency graphs enables simultaneous work on multiple design variations. These graphs capture and reveal complex data flow across alternative parametric CAD models. Second, prototype-based modeling provides a weak notion of inheritance enabling incremental description of differences between alternatives. The system is intended to be general enough to be used in different CAD platforms and other systems using graph-based modeling. The three basic system functions are definition of alternatives (variations) using prototype-based modeling, structural and parametric divergences of the prototypes, and interactive comparison. The goal of this research is consistent with the general qualities expected from any creativity support tools: enabling exploration and simultaneous development of variations.

                        Conventional CAD systems focus design attention on the representation of the artifact being designed. Currently industry attention is on systems in which a designed artifact is represented parametrically, that is, the representation admits rapid change of design dimensions and structure. Parametrization increases complexity of both designer task and interface as designers must model not only the artifact being designed, but a conceptual structure that guides variation. Parametrization has both positive and negative task, outcome and perceptual consequences for designers. Positively, parametrization can enhance search for designs better adapted to context, can facilitate discovery of new forms and kinds of form-making, can reduce the time and effort required for change and reuse, and can yield better understandings of the conceptual structure of the artifact being designed. Negatively, parametrization may require additional effort, may increase complexity of local design decisions and increases the number of items to which attention must be paid in task completion.

We define shape schema grammars, starting with a notation for schemata in general and shape schemata in particular. Schema equality is shown to have at least three possible definitions, of which schema consistency is the most useful. A limited notion of shape schema maximality potentially reduces the size and redundancy of a given schema. Shape schema subpart is a multifunction returning all of the possible ways that one shape schema can be embedded in another. Shape schema difference and addition complete the basic mathematical operations over shape schemata required to define shape schema rules, grammars and languages.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">When people solve problems they explore a variety of different solutions. Parametric systems have been added to the interaction models of design tools to make it easier to make changes to a design. Just as cell is changed in a spreadsheet, when a parameter is changed all parts of the design that depend on that parameter update. While tools with parametric systems are powerful, users are limited to single state solutions and are forced to use workarounds like using layers, and file naming conventions. To add support for alternatives in parametric systems, we introduce a new type of node called a subjunctive node and describe a data-flow language Shiro designed to allow artists and designers to define alternatives in parametric systems.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Although the Discrete EVent System specification (DEVS) has over recent decades provided systems engineers with a scalable approach to modeling and simulation, the formalism has seen little uptake in many other disciplines where it could be equally useful. Our observations of end-user programmers confronted with DEVS theory or software suggest that learning barriers are largely responsible for this lack of utilization. To address these barriers, we apply ideas from Human-Computer Interaction to the design of visual interfaces intended to promote their users' effective knowledge of essential DEVS concepts. The first step is to propose a set of names that make these concepts easier to learn. We then design and provide rationale for visual interfaces for interacting with various elements of DEVS models and simulation runs. Both the names and interface designs are evaluated using the Cognitive Dimension of Notations framework, which emphasizes trade-offs between fourteen aspects of information artifacts. As a whole, this work illustrates a generally applicable design process for the development of interactive formalism-based simulation environments that are learnable and usable to those who are not experts in simulation formalisms.</p>
